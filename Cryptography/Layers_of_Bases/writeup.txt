Download the file (flag.enc) provided in the question

Use an online base cryptography decoder to decode encrypted text in the file downloaded
First, decode encrypted text from Base 45
Then, continue decoding with Base 64
From Base 64 continue decoding to Base 45 again and then lastly to Base 32

Flag is GCTF2023{L4y3rs_0f_3ncrypt10n}
